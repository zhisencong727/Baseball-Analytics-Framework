Visualization of Results:
    Target Distribution Summary : Display the target label distrbution in the validation set and compare it with the predicted labels in order to gauge how well calibrated the model is.

    Confusion Matrix : Constructed and displayed to specifically see how well the model does on each individual classes and whether it is over or under predicting each class

    Classification Report (Precision Recall F1) : Classification Report from sklearn metrics to show the precision, recall, and f1 score on each class


Different Time Period:
    Model Drift
    Data Drift

Further Plans for Improvement:
    Model Calibration
